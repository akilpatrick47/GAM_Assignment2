# MathLibraryDemo

### Library used
- OpenTK (though all math is implemented manually)

### Implemented operations
- **Vector**: addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product  
- **Matrix**: identity, scaling, rotation (Z axis), multiplication  

### Example output
Vector Operations:
(1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6) = (5, 7, 9)

(1, 2, 3) - (4, 5, 6) = (-3, -3, -3)

Dot((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)) = 32

Cross((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)) = (-3, 6, -3)

Matrix Transformations:

Original vector: (1, 0, 0)

After scaling+rotation: (1.4142135, 1.4142135, 0)
